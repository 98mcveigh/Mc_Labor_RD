#Mc Labor R&D Application

This application does market research by searching for and collecting company names, addresses and contact information (specifically emails as of 3-31-2020).

Application is started by running gui.py which will open up the application. The research functionality is then accessed by entering a query in the entry label and searching.

A file containing the results of the search are saved to a folder on the desktop named "Email_Collection"
